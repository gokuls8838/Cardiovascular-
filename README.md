# Project 1: Cardiovascular Disease Prediction (AI Minor Project)

## Introduction

Heart disease is a worldwide health concern, being one of the leading causes of death across the globe. Early prediction and detection are vital for effective treatment and prevention. However, real clinical datasets are often huge, with millions of records and many attributes. In this project, we use advanced machine learning techniques to predict cardiovascular disease accurately from a large dataset (~2GB), following a step-by-step process suitable for real-world applications.

## Data Preprocessing

**Handling Big Data Efficiently:**  
Traditional approaches struggle with very large files. To handle a 2GB file, we read data in chunks and preprocess each part separately to manage memory usage.

```python
import pandas as pd

chunks = []
chunk_size = 100_000  # Adjust if needed

for chunk in pd.read_csv('cardio_large.csv', chunksize=chunk_size):
    # Remove rows with missing values
    chunk = chunk.dropna()
    # Example: Encode 'sex' as binary
    if 'sex' in chunk.columns:
        chunk['sex'] = chunk['sex'].map({'male': 1, 'female': 0})
    # Encode any other categorical columns if present
    for col in chunk.select_dtypes(include='object').columns:
        chunk[col] = chunk[col].astype('category').cat.codes
    chunks.append(chunk)

df = pd.concat(chunks, ignore_index=True)
print("Total records after loading and cleaning:", len(df))
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization

**Sampling for Visualization:**  
Directly plotting millions of records overwhelms memory and visualization tools. Instead, we use a random sample for analysis.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sample_df = df.sample(frac=0.01, random_state=42)
sns.pairplot(sample_df, hue='target')
plt.suptitle('Sample Data Pairplot', y=1.01)
plt.show()
```

## Correlation Analysis

**Finding Relationships Between Features:**  
We generate a correlation matrix to find associations among features, helping us understand which attributes influence heart disease.

```python
corr = sample_df.corr()
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=False, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Feature Correlation Heatmap')
plt.show()
```

## Model Building and Evaluation

**Splitting the Data:**  
We split the data for training and testing, ensuring that our predictions are validated on unseen data.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

X = df.drop('target', axis=1)
y = df['target']

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)  # Good for many ML algorithms

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)
```

**Training and Comparing Multiple Machine Learning Models:**  
We train several common models and compare their performance.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix

models = {
    'Random Forest': RandomForestClassifier(n_jobs=-1),
    'Logistic Regression': LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000, n_jobs=-1),
    'KNN': KNeighborsClassifier(n_jobs=-1),
    'Decision Tree': DecisionTreeClassifier(),
    'SVM': SVC(),
}

for name, model in models.items():
    print(f"Training {name}...")
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    preds = model.predict(X_test)
    acc = accuracy_score(y_test, preds)
    cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, preds)
    print(f"{name} accuracy: {acc:.4f}")
    print(f"Confusion Matrix:\n{cm}\n")
```

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can help predict cardiovascular disease risk using a very large dataset. We used efficient memory management strategies (chunking, sampling), performed exploratory analysis, and trained multiple machine learning models. The best-performing model can be selected and used to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and intervention.

## Saving the Best Model

```python
import joblib

# Replace 'Random Forest' with your best model
best_model = models['Random Forest']
joblib.dump(best_model, 'best_heart_model.joblib')
joblib.dump(scaler, 'scaler.joblib')
print('Model and scaler saved for deployment!')
```
